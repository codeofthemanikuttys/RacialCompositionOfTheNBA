NBA NUMBERS
===========

According to racial equality activist Richard Lapchick, the NBA in 2015 was com\
posed of 74.4 percent black players, 23.3 percent white players, 1.8 percent La\
tino players, and 0.2 percent Asian players.

========

1. Most of us know that a significant fraction of the NBA is black. You don't need
to be an Einstein to know this. But did you know that it is nearly three-quarters
black?

2. There are some people who are clearly Hispanic. You can tell that just from their
names. But that number is fairly small. Just 1.8 percent Latino.

3. There are virtually no Chinese or Indian players in the NBA. China + India =
more than a third of the world's population. Virtually no representation.
