# RacialCompositionOfTheNBA


NBA NUMBERS
===========

According to racial equality activist Richard Lapchick, the NBA in 2015 was com\
posed of 74.4 percent black players, 23.3 percent white players, 1.8 percent La\
tino players, and 0.2 percent Asian players.

COMMENTS
========

1. Most of us know that a significant fraction of the NBA is black. You don't need
to be an Einstein to know this. But did you know that it is nearly three-quarters
black?

2. There are some people who are clearly Hispanic. You can tell that just from their
names. But that number is fairly small. Just 1.8 percent Latino.

3. There are virtually no Chinese or Indian players in the NBA. China + India =
more than a third of the world's population. Virtually no representation.

It’s hard for humans to evaluate data from two different perspectives at once. For example, let’s take another look at my old reliable data source, men’s 100 meter sprint records.

Poking around at the Wikipedia page on National Records in Athletics, I come up with these estimates of racial records (I am no doubt missing some):

West African: 9.58 (Jamaica)
Southwest African: 9.86 (Namibia)
South East Africa: 9.89 (Zimbabwe)
European: 9.92 (France)
Australia Aborigine-White Mix: 9.93
East Asian: 10.00 (Japan)
East African: 10.26 (Kenya)
Pacific Islander: 10.26 (Fiji)
South Asian: 10.30 (India)
Papuan: 10.40 (Papua New Guinea)

As of ten days ago (it’s currently prime time for track and field, so this probably has changed), 81 men had run under 10.00 seconds in the 100m dash, and all but two were black. So, that’s a big difference.

On the other hand, consider the difference between the best time of Usain Bolt of Jamaica (the world record of 9.58 seconds) and the two Indians who have run India’s national record time. Now, India is not a very sports-oriented society, but the difference is still only 0.72 seconds, or well under 10%. So, compared to, say, tortoises and hares, human racial groups are pretty similar at sprinting.

On the other other hand, these racial differences really do make a difference in the real world.

5. Another article by Steve Sailer - this one has a graph, which I have not reproduced.

Not shown on these graph are all the regions with negligible representation. In particular, South Asia is a black hole for sports other than cricket.

It`s true that each culture has its peculiar favorite length—Americans in the 400, Kenyans in the 3000m steeplechase, and Maghrebians in the 1500.

Still, hereditary differences are the simplest explanation for why track-crazy countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, and Morocco can’t buy a sprinter, while Jamaica can’t produce a competitive miler. Runners and coaches always have an incentive to explore longer and shorter distances.

The relationship between amount of effort and amount of success in running is usually assumed to be high, but the relationship is complicated. Sprinting requires less exercise to be world class than just about any other sport. In preparation for winning four gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Carl Lewis worked out eight hours per week.
